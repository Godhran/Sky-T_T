## Could have, would have, should have
I experimented with some VISX and VIS and with more time I would have decided on exactly which library I would focus on, I think VISX produces considerably better looking infographics but is more time consuming compared to VIS. If I had more time I would 100% use VISX.

#####Time series
* Leveraged more VISX
* Reinstate tracker ball on chart, changing the chart to one that's y-axis begin at the lowest value has created inconsistencies in the position of the marker.
* Brush chart for viewing portions of the time series

#####Content Data
* Leveraged more VISX
* Filtering by movie genres
* VISX horizontal bar chart with previous & current views

#####Overall
* Better design, not fully happy with how the design ended up with colours / assets.
* Responsive
* Toggle between coloured and monochrome mode
